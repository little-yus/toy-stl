# Toy STL
This project implements some components from the C++ Standard Library that I find particularly interesting. It mostly follows C++20 standard, but I've also implemented some features from newer standards (for example `std::basic_const_iterator`). As the main goal of the project is learning, don't expect full standard compliance, performance or safety.

## Progress:
- Containers
	- [x] `vector`
	- [ ] `deque` (Work in Progress)
	- [ ] `unordered_set`
	- [ ] `unordered_map`
- Iterators
	- [x] `reverse_iterator`
	- [x] `const_iterator` (C++23)
- Smart pointers
	- [ ] `unique_ptr`
	- [ ] `shared_ptr`
	- [ ] `weak_ptr`
